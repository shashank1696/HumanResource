Classification of Employees leaving the Company for different aspects using Decision Tree Classification Algorithm

## Goal of this Project: 
This project is to predict and classify for various aspects and check if the employees are leaving the company.

## Attributes
1)  satisfaction level(binary)
2)  last evaluation(binary)
3)  number project(binary) - number of Projects undertaken
4)  average month hours(binary) - average monthly hours the employee has worked for
5)  time spend company(binary) - time spent in the company while working
6)  Work accident(binary) - work accident is "discrete occurrence in the course of work" leading to physical or mental occupational injury
7)  left(binary) - whether the employee left the company or not
8)  promotion last 5years(binary) - promotions made by the company/employee in last 5 years
9)  sales (categorial: IT,sales,support,hr,RandD,management,marketing,product mng,technical) - sales by different departments in a company 
10) salary (categorial: low,medium,high)

## Data Handling
1) Importing Data with Pandas
2) Cleaning Data
3) Exploring Data through Visualizations with graphs
4) Data Prediction

## Packages required in Python
1) pandas
2) numpy
3) sklearn.tree
4) sklearn.model_selection
5) pydotplus
6) from IPython.display importing Image
7) sklearn.metrics
8) matplotlib.pyplot

## Conclusions
Classification of various aspects are considered and Decision tree is constructed using Decision Tree Classifier
Algorithm with 98.1% accuarcy for the Employees to leave the company.
